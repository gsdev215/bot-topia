# Bot-Topia

current version is 1.0.12


Welcome! Bot-Topia is an addon that allows you to build bots, craft parts and add them to your bot. You can even craft Bot Chips to program your bots to do jobs for you.This is my first addon and is a work in progress. Enjoy!

## Known Bug
When you install Bot-Topia there may be a warning in Minecraft that says missing dependencies. This a bug in Minecraft and is safe to ignore. It just means that Minecraft doesn't think the behavior pack and resource pack are connected to each other. So Minecraft will not automatically apply the resource pack. When you add Bot-Topia behavior pack to a world also check that the resource pack is active and you are all good to go.

## Change Log

- added lumber chip to bot crafter trade
